    <h1>Recursion</h1>
    <p>
      We have locked box. The key is in another box but that box is filled with
      more boxes and so on. The key is in one of those boxes within the second
      box. What algorithm can we write to find the key?
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a function that opens up a box to check for a key. If the key is
      present (true), our function stops there and returns the key. Otherwise we
      need to invoke our function again to open another box and check for a key.
      If we find key (true) we stop, otherwise we keep invoking our function to
      open another box.
    </p>
    <script>
      //This is Psuedo code and may not be written properly
      function unlockBox(box, key) {
        if (box === key) return "We found the key";
        else if (box != key) {
          unlockBox(box);
        }
      }
    </script>
    <h2>Base Case/ Guard Clause</h2>
    <p>
      Recursive functions can easily become infinite loops. When writing a
      recursive function, always write the condition we're looking for. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to ensure our function stops when we find our true condition. Like
      when we find our missing key to the box!
    </p>
    <p>
      This first condition is called the base case. Some might call it the guard
      clause.
    </p>
    <h2>Recursive Base</h2>
    <p>
      This part is after the guard clause. It's what we want to happen if our
      base case is false. We didn't find the key so we need to open another box.
    </p>
    <h2>The Call Stack</h2>
    <p>
      We're planning a barbeque with a to do list. We'll be pushing(adding) and
      popping(remove topmost item) items. As write things down on sticky notes
      and push them to the pile, we've created a stack! In our machine, this
      known as the "Call Stack".
    </p>
    <script>
      //Here's a simple function that creates a call stack
      function greet(name) {
        console.log("Hi " + name);
        greet2(name);
        bye(name);
      }
      function greet2(name) {
        console.log("How are you " + name + "?");
      }
      function bye(name) {
        console.log("Goodbye " + name + "!");
      }
      greet("Alex");
    </script>
    <p>
      Our simple greeting program creates call stack. In the browser console,
      our call stack reads in wrong direction. The last function we call "bye()"
      is actually on top and the first function "greet()" is at the bottom. Our
      call stack is saving the variable info (the name of who we're greeting to
      pass it to the next functions.)
    </p>
    <!-- Exercise 3.1: Our variable's value is "Maggie." The first function called was "greet()" and the second function was "greet2()." -->
    <h3>The Call Stack and Recursion</h3>
    <p>
      Recursive functions will have a call stack. The factorial equation is
      Recursion in action! We pass our number "n", if "n" is bigger than 1 we
      need store it memory, subtract 1 and multiple "n" & "n - 1". But we need
      to keep going. We then have pass "n - 1" until we hit the base case of
      when "n" is 0 and we can stop our factorial equation.
    </p>
    <script>
      //Let's write a recursive factorial function in javaScript
      function factorial(number) {
        if (number === 0) {
          return 1;
        } else {
          console.log("current number: ", number);
          return number * factorial(number - 1);
        }
      }
      /*What's happening when we do 3!
      factorial(3)
      1st: else: 3 * factorial(3 - 1)
      factorial(2)
      2nd: else: 3 * 2 * factorial(2 - 1)
      factorial(1)
      3rd: else: 3 * 2 * 1 * factorial(1 - 1)
      factorial(0)
      3 * 2 * 1 * 1
      */
    </script>
    <h3>The Box and Key problem revisited.</h3>
    <p>We open Box A which has Box B and Box C.</p>
    <p>Then we open Box B, then Box D, then empty.</p>
    <p>We never went back to Box C!</p>
  </body>
  <script>
    /*This example solves the issue of checking new piles of boxes when initial piles yield no key! */

    // Function to check if a key exists in the boxes
    function hasKey(boxes, key, visited = new Set()) {
      /* We pass an array of boxes, key (the string we're looking for, in this case it's "key"), and the optional visited.
      visited = new Set()) â†’ 
      */
      // Base case: if the current box contains the key, return true
      if (boxes.includes(key)) {
        return true;
      }

      // Mark the current box as visited
      visited.add(boxes);
      console.log(visited.add(boxes));
      // Recursive case: search inside the boxes
      for (const box of boxes) {
        // Check if the current box is not a key (i.e., it contains other boxes)
        if (!visited.has(box) && Array.isArray(box)) {
          // Recursively search inside the inner box
          if (hasKey(box, key, visited)) {
            return true;
          }
        } else if (box === key) {
          // Check if the current box is the key we are looking for
          return true;
        }
      }

      // If the key is not found in any of the boxes, return false
      return false;
    }

    // Example usage:
    const boxes = [
      ["boxA", "boxB"],
      ["boxC"],
      ["boxD", "boxE", "boxF", ["boxG", "key"]],
    ];

    const keyToFind = "key";
    console.log(hasKey(boxes, keyToFind)); // Output: true
