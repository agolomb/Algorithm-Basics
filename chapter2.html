    <p>
      Two of the most basic data structures are arrays and linked lists. Linked
      lists are generally better to use but both have pros and cons.
    </p>
    <h3>Arrays</h3>
    <p>
      This is list where all the items are stored right next to each other.
      Here's an example in JavaScript:
    </p>
    <p>var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,]</p>
    <p>
      What's a pro for an array? It's greating for reading items because you
      know the address of the next item. How? In the JavaScript example above,
      what's the index of "4"? Its index is 3, because it's an array, we know
      that item 4 is the 3rd item. This means arrays are better for reading
      data.
    </p>
    <h3>Linked Lists</h3>
    <p>
      Items are not necessarily stored right next to each like arrays. Instead
      there memory addresses are stored next to each other but there actual
      locations can be random. As an analogy, we can think of a chain of command
      at a company. The taxi driver reports to the taxi manager. The manager
      reports to the director. The director reports to the supervisor. The
      supervisor reports to CEO. These employees are not all right next to each
      other but if we look at each employee, we can see who they report to and
      who reports to them. They do not need to be standing in a specific order
      (like an array!)
    </p>
    <p>
      What's a pro for linked lists? We don't need our items to be right next to
      each other. This makes them much better for inserting more data.
    </p>
    <p>
      What's a con of a linked list? If we have all of our taxi company
      employees in a random list but we want to know who is 3rd in command, we
      can't just go to the 3rd index. We must start at the lowest in command and
      go up the up chain but looking at each item. This means linked lists are
      worse for reading data whereas arrays are better for reading data.
    </p>
    <h4>Why are linked lists better for insert?</h4>
    <p>
      Since each item points to the next item in order even though their
      locations are random, we can insert a new item in the middle and the other
      items will still point to where we wanted them to.
    </p>
    <h3>Takeways:</h3>
    <h4>When storing multiple items, we use an array or a list.</h4>
    <h4>In an array, our items are stored right next to each other.</h4>
    <h4>
      In lists, items are stored all over and each item has the address of the
      next item.
    </h4>
    <h4>Arrays are better at READs</h4>
    <h4>Lists are better at INSERT and DELETE.</h4>
